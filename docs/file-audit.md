# Platform repository file audit

Audited on 2026-10-10. Every retained source file is listed below. The platform
repo is the operational companion to the app: it holds operator guides, local
runtime tools, verification, monitoring integration and recovery exercises.
Kubernetes desired state belongs to boutique-gitops; AWS resources belong to
boutique-infrastructure; shared Jenkins delivery logic belongs to boutique-ci.

## What to use first

Follow [deploy-cicd-kind.md](deploy-cicd-kind.md) for the existing Debian laptop.
You do not need to run every script or install the two-cluster exercise. Read
[beginner-guide.md](beginner-guide.md) when you need the architecture explained.
The small runbooks are quick operational checklists, while the deployment guides
teach the commands and the reliability documents define objectives.

| Folder | Responsibility | Required for the primary laptop path? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/` and `docs/runbooks/` | Architecture, deployment, operations and recovery | Use the main guide and relevant references |
| `docs/validation-artifacts/` | Latest component evidence | Read-only evidence; not a deployment input |
| `scripts/` | Local setup, verification, backup and optional lab automation | Local Kubernetes secret setup and smoke/rollout verification are relevant |
| `tests/config/` and `tests/smoke/` | Regression checks and functional acceptance | Run applicable checks; smoke validates the deployed app |
| `local/` | Optional Compose and manual-image kind configuration | No, when using the existing cluster and published images |
| `local/production-lab/` | Optional two-cluster exercise | No; requires a suitable larger host |
| `monitoring/` | Compose observability, native validators and local mock fixtures | Optional after the app works; Kubernetes configuration comes from GitOps Helm |
| `monitoring/incident-bridge/` and `monitoring/servicenow/` | Optional incident adapter and instance-side reference | No; opt in explicitly |
| `workspace/` | Editor convenience | No |

## Cleanup and corrections

Removed five unused Kubernetes configuration copies: the homelab/nonprod/
production Prometheus files, `alloy-kubernetes.alloy` and `alertmanager.yml`.
They were consumed only by local validation; deployments already render the
GitOps Helm chart. Four were exact duplicates, while the generic Alloy copy
lacked the chart's namespace restriction. Native validation now extracts the
actual Helm ConfigMaps for all three profiles, both Slack-only and incident
modes, and checks their Prometheus rules, receiver routing and Alloy syntax.
No Kubernetes deployment resources were removed.

Removed unused `workspace/workspace.json`: no script or deployment consumed it.
The VS Code workspace remains useful. Its README now explains editor usage
instead of repeating the project overview and old validation claims.

Corrected `k8s-secrets.py`: API/auth failures now stop provisioning rather than
being mistaken for missing credentials. Existing secret names are read before
writes; a partial Redis pair is rejected. New objects use create rather than
apply, preventing accidental replacement after a concurrent creation. Existing
secrets, user volumes, private CA state and ignored credentials were preserved.
This helper remains for local development data; AWS uses its reviewed secret
manager/ESO configuration.

Retained Compose monitoring configs because they use container DNS, filesystem
paths and accelerated local mock routing. Kubernetes configs use pod discovery,
namespace scopes and environment-specific rules. These are distinct supported
runtime paths. Both the local notification drill and ServiceNow reference remain
optional, and neither is evidence of live external integration acceptance.
The long beginner guide, focused deployment guides and short runbooks serve
different reading/operational purposes; no retired delivery workflow is retained.

## Validation and boundaries

```bash
# From boutique-platform; requires the reviewed Helm tool and PyYAML.
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests/config -v
python3 scripts/test_production_lab.py -v
bash monitoring/validate.sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s monitoring/incident-bridge -p 'test_bridge.py' -v
python3 -m unittest discover -s monitoring/incident-bridge -p 'test_receivers.py' -v
# Real isolated PostgreSQL integration; build this runtime image using the adapter README first.
python3 monitoring/incident-bridge/run-postgres-tests.py --image boutique-incident-bridge:test
```

Configuration validation includes exact image/chart promotion, rollback and
rollout guards; monitoring validation uses native Prometheus, Alertmanager and
Alloy binaries in pinned containers. Python/shell syntax, Compose structure,
JSON/YAML parsing, Markdown links and the complete inventory are also checked.
No test in this audit sends live Slack notifications, creates ServiceNow tickets,
changes laptop clusters or applies AWS resources.

The PostgreSQL integration test uses its own disposable database/network and
removes only those resources. Full Kubernetes deployment, live delivery,
monitoring-wide HA, scheduled/off-host backups and complete DR acceptance remain
separate target-host work. Existing [validation.md](validation.md) records the
component evidence and these limits; [recovery targets](recovery-targets.md) and
[the DR runbook](runbooks/disaster-recovery.md) describe objectives to measure.
