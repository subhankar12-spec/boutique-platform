# Jenkins setup: one controller, reviewed builds, GitOps PRs

Use the existing controller and connected agent when available. Do not overwrite
its home/security settings by applying fresh-install JCasC. Follow
[the main deployment guide](deploy-cicd-kind.md) for the exact Debian sequence.

## Controller and agents

The controller has zero executors; a Linux inbound agent with label
`trusted-release`, one executor and a private rootless Docker daemon runs reviewed
main builds, seed, promotion, rollback and optional read-only verification.
The Docker workspace must exist at the same absolute path in the daemon host
and agent so bind-mounted integration fixtures work. No rootful host socket is
needed on the controller or build agent. Labels route work, not security.

A separate `terraform-trusted` executor is optional for authorized AWS work. It
needs its own short-lived/scoped cloud identity, not credentials shared with app
builds. Arbitrary PR/fork execution is disabled; add disposable isolated workers
and credential restrictions before enabling untrusted builds.

For a new controller only:

```bash
cd boutique-ci
bash jenkins/scripts/init-local.sh
docker compose -f jenkins/compose.yaml build
docker compose -f jenkins/compose.yaml up -d release-controller
```

The configuration starts one loopback-bound controller and retains release-home.
It is not an upgrade/replacement command for a manually created `jenkins`
container. Back up Jenkins encrypted credentials and home before changes.
Controller/agent artifact verification and plugin locks remain in place.

## Shared library and job definitions

Configure the **Global Untrusted Pipeline Library** `boutique-ci`, Modern SCM/Git,
repository `https://github.com/subhankar12-spec/boutique-ci.git`, default version
set to a reviewed full commit SHA, implicit loading false and overrides false.
Set `BOUTIQUE_CONTROLLER_ROLE=release` in global environment properties.
The variable is a guardrail; it does not isolate code or credentials.

Create a **Pipeline from SCM** seed pinned to that reviewed CI revision with
script path `pipelines/seed-release.Jenkinsfile`. Keep
`SUPPRESS_AUTOMATIC_BUILDS=true` during setup, then rerun it with false to allow
main builds. It runs `jenkins/jobs/release.groovy`. Review Job DSL configuration
API approvals if Jenkins requests them; do not globally disable sandboxing.

The seed generates four app multibranch jobs, optional platform adapter build,
promote/rollback/verify and infrastructure. Only main is discovered. Existing
jobs not present in the definition are preserved: disable obsolete bootstrap,
policy and validation jobs manually after checking active runs.

## Credentials

| ID | Kind | Scope/purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| github-read | Username/password | Read-only SCM; Contents and Metadata read |
| ghcr-publish | Username/password | Supported package publication token |
| gitops-pr | Username/password | Only GitOps Contents/PR writes; no bypass permission |
| gitops-checks | Secret text | GitOps Contents/PR reads and Commit statuses write |
| kubeconfig-dev/staging/production | Secret file | Optional verifier: read-only deployments/pods and named Argo Application |
| boutique-ca-dev/staging/production | Secret file | Public trusted TLS CA; not a private signing key |

A distinct bot creates GitOps PRs so a human reviewer can approve. Current
username/password bindings support PATs. Adopt a GitHub App only with compatible
short-lived credential handling; do not put an installation ID in a PAT field.
No release-artifact/evidence keys  are consumed anymore.
Remove those credentials after migrating pins/jobs and stopping obsolete builds.

For automated verification, configure `BOUTIQUE_DEV_ORIGIN`,
`BOUTIQUE_STAGING_ORIGIN`, and `BOUTIQUE_PRODUCTION_ORIGIN`. HTTPS is required;
only laptop dev accepts exactly `http://localhost:8088`. For a public trust chain,
a public CA bundle can be the file credential. Preserve certificate verification.
Production credentials belong only on approved jobs/workers.

## Delivery and approval

Application main builds test/scan/publish and optionally request dev promotion.
Promotion opens a PR and finishes; it does not poll, merge or deploy. The parent
frees the build executor before calling promotion. Staging/production copy the
preceding environment's image digest/chart without rebuilding. Reviewers confirm
its live smoke/rollout result and database compatibility.

GitOps PRs run **boutique/gitops-validation** through the ordinary
`boutique-gitops-validate` Jenkins job. It reads candidate configuration with
protected-main tools and does not execute candidate scripts. The GitHub status
token is bound only for PR metadata/status API calls, not Helm rendering.
The parent queues validation without waiting, allowing the same single executor
rather than requiring a dedicated policy worker.

Keep `gitops-checks` as Secret text with GitOps Contents/PR read and Commit
statuses write. Require its status, current-base checks, independent review and
CODEOWNERS, stale-review dismissal and no bypass/force pushes. Replace the old
boutique/gitops-policy status. Rerun validation for manual PRs or updated heads.
The job checks configuration, not whether the previous environment passed live
smoke tests; that remains a reviewer responsibility.

On a laptop, use manual/scheduled branch scans; do not expose unauthenticated
Jenkins HTTP to satisfy webhooks. A production webhook endpoint needs TLS,
authentication/signature checks and proper network/access controls.

## Validation

```bash
python3 jenkins/scripts/doctor.py
python3 jenkins/scripts/smoke-controller.py --directory /tmp/boutique-jenkins-check
```

The isolated harness verifies the locked core/plugins, JCasC, actual Job DSL and
Declarative syntax. It exercises failure propagation with no external deploy.
It does not prove GHCR authorization, remote agent provisioning, the complete
application pipeline, Argo sync, notifications or database restore. Verify those
on the target host and retain ordinary build/test/operation reports.
